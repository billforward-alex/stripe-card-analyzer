```
./config/config.js
./input/input.js
```

Obviously configure your `./config/config.js` appropriately.

By default, input is read from `./input/input.js`, and output is spat into `./output/output.js`.

Input should be populated with a newline-delimited list of Stripe customer IDs.

Setup repository using `npm install`.
