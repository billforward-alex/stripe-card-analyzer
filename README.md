Please make the following files, following the examples which neighbour them:

```
./config/config.js
./input/input.js
```

Obviously configure your `./config/config.js` appropriately.

By default, input is read from `./input/input.js`, and output is spat into `./output/output.js`.

Setup repository using `npm install`.

Invoke this program using `node index.js`.
